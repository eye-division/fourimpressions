My study of clay  has influenced all my art in the use of texture and form.&quot;</p>

<p> She says &quot;Clay is more than just a material to me, it is the fabric of our history and life passed. &nbsp;I employ the simplest techniques, thousands of years old, dating back to our first vessels which fundamentally evolved our way of living. &nbsp;&nbsp;I hand build using various clays to give texture and colour. &nbsp;I fire using a range of techniques including Raku, Saggar and Smoke Firing which deliver unique markings to each piece. Through these vessels we make connections, expressing emotion and a shared dialogue.&quot;</.>
