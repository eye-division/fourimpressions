  Joanne finds inspiration in a diversity of places - from the landscape and sea
  to urban scenes and found objects. Her recent body of work has come from an
  increasingly intuitive and experimental working practice.  Of equal importance
  to the 'subject' is the tactility of the materials she uses, their physical
  application and 'mark making' and the picture surface itself, with its rich
  history of layers and texture that unfold in the course of the     making of a
  painting.  Joanne has exhibited widely throughout the UK, she has work in many
  private and corporate collections and is a permanent gallery artist with the
  award winning Porthminster Gallery in St Ives.
